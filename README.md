Python Questions

This repository contains a collection of Python questions and solutions in the form of a Jupyter notebook. It is designed to help learners, students, and professionals strengthen their Python programming skills through practice.

Features

A variety of Python questions covering fundamental and intermediate concepts

Step-by-step solutions and explanations

Code snippets written and executed in Jupyter Notebook format

Useful as a self-study resource or for interview preparation

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8 or higher
Download from the official Python website
 or install via package managers such as brew, apt, or conda.

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Jupyter provides an interactive environment for running and exploring the notebook. Install using:

pip install notebook


or, for JupyterLab:

pip install jupyterlab


Common Python libraries
The notebook may use standard libraries as well as widely used third-party packages. To ensure compatibility, install the following:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn


These libraries provide numerical operations, data handling, and visualization support. Even if not all of them are required immediately, they cover the majority of common Python exercises.

numpy: for numerical computations and array operations

pandas: for data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib: for basic data visualization

seaborn: for advanced and aesthetic visualizations

If the notebook imports additional libraries, install them as needed using pip install <package_name>.
